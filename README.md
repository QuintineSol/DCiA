4. Work on task
5. Create pull request
6. Add "Closes #<task-number>" in the description where you replace <task-number> with the number of your task (which can be found on the SCRUM board)
7. Someone else reviews the code and merges the pull request (then the task is automatically moved to "Done" on the SCRUM board)
